Below are important examples of attribute types a requirement may contain:

### Functional
Describes the function or tasks to be performed by the system or system element functions.

### Performance
Defines how well a function or task is to be performed under certain conditions. There may be multiple performance requirement associated with a singular function, functional requirement or task.

### Usability/Quality-in-Use
Provides a basis for design and evaluation system in order to meet the users needs. These requirements should be used in conjunction with, and form part of, the overall [[Requirements Specifications|requirements specification]] of a system. 


### Interface
An Interface defines how the system interacts with internal system elements and external systems.


### Design Constraints
A requirement that limits the options for the designer. It defines immovable boundaries and limits. One example would be "The system shall interface with legacy system"


### Process
These requirements are imposed by a statement of work. Process requirements include:
- National, State, or Local Law
- Environmental Laws
- Acquirer/User Relationships
- Corporate Policy or Practice
- A Particular Design Method
- Specific Work Directives
- Etcetera
These are usually captured in agreement documentation such as:
- Contracts
- Statement of Work
- Quality Plans


### Non-Functional
Specifies under which the system is required to operate, exist or system properties. They define how a system is supposed to *be*. Quality Requirements and Human Factors Requirements are both examples of non-functional requirements

#### Quality
Include a number of 'ilities' such as:
- Transportability
- Survivability
- Flexibility
- Portability
- Reusability
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Security
The list of non-functional properties should be determined before creating the requirements document. This should be used to the system being developed.

Additional guidance may be found in [[ISO 25030.pdf|ISO/IEC 25030]] and [[ISO 25010 - Quality Model.pdf|ISO/IEC 25030]]
#### Human Factors
State required for the outcomes of interactions with the human users in terms of:
- Safety
- Performance
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Health
- Well-Being
- Satisfaction
