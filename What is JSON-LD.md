Json-LD combines the concept of linked data with the JSON structure in order to better communicate data in a human and computer readable format.

## Linked Data
Linked data that is interlinked with other data making it easier to semantically query said data. It is Build upon Web Technologies such as [[HTTP]], [[RDF]], and [[Uniform Resource Identifiers|URIs]]. instead of presenting the data for solely human readers, linked data structures in a way that can be shared with other computers.

### Linked Data Guiding Principals
1. [[Uniform Resource Identifiers]] (URIs) should be used to identify individual things (**Identifiable**)
2. [[HTTP]] URIs should allow the data to be looked, interpreted, and subsequently "dereferenced" (Quarriable)
3. What the data identifies should be defined through open standards such as:- [[RDF]]
	- [[SPARQL]]
